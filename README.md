# Etch-a-Sketch project suggested by The Odin Project
This etch-a-sketch has 16x16 default grid that will allow you draw anything based on hovering your mouse across the browser window.
This was my second JavaScript project that allowed me to practice new skills:
- event listeners
- DOM manipulation.

## Cool Feature
- Able to regrid after clearing the board with the clear button. Regrid up to 99x99.
- Responsive
